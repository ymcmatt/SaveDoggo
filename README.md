# SaveDoggo

Role: Game Programmer/ Game Desginer
Team Size: 5 (2 programmers, 2 artists, 1 sound desginer)
Project Duration: 2 weeks

Programming Challenges:
   -  Dog Interactions
   -  Script-driven cut scene
   -  Enemy AI

Design Challenges:
   -  Natural way to involve dog with puzzle solving
   -  Puzzle Design for Naive Users
   -  UI and BGM to create intense tone for chasing
In this project we are trying to create a combination of puzzle solving/ chasing game. The player constantly has an enemy (in the story police government) chasing after him, and he has to collaborate and interact with his dog (Gougou) to get out of there. 

The most difficult part is how to interact with Gougou in puzzle solving. We have designed multiple interaction strategies but after some play-testing we decide to go with "left mouse to ask dog run to a spot and right mouse to ask dog to follow".
